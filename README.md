**Decentralized KYC Verification**

**Agenda**
Central Bank and Multinational banks face issues in tracking money laundering activities used for terrorism and other crimes. It is a threat to 
national security and also adversely affects the economy.

**Background**
KYC (Know Your Customer) is a service provided by financial institutions such as banks. There are both public and private sector banks managed
by a central bank. These banks are banned by the central bank from adding any new customer and do any more customer KYCs as they see suspicious
activities that need to be sorted out first. Despite this, the banks add new customers and do the KYC in the background.

Develop a Smart Contract that offers following functions:
a. Add new bank to Blockchain ledger
b. Add new customer to the bank
c. Check KYC status of existing bank customer
d. Perform the KYC of the customer and update the status
